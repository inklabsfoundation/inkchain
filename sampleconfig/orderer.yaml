################################################################################
General:

    # Ledger Type: The ledger type to provide to the orderer.
    # Two non-production ledger types are provided for test purposes only:
    #  - ram: An in-memory ledger whose contents are lost on restart.
    #  - json: A simple file ledger that writes blocks to disk in JSON format.
    # Only one production ledger type is provided:
    #  - file: A production file-based ledger.
    LedgerType: file

    # Listen address: The IP on which to bind to listen.
    ListenAddress: 127.0.0.1

    # Listen port: The port on which to bind to listen.
    ListenPort: 7050

    # TLS: TLS settings for the GRPC server.
    TLS:
        Enabled: false

    # Log Level: The level at which to log. This accepts logging specifications
    # per: inkchain/docs/Setup/logging-control.md
    LogLevel: info

    # Genesis method: The method by which the genesis block for the orderer
    # system channel is specified. Available options are "provisional", "file":
    #  - provisional: Utilizes a genesis profile, specified by GenesisProfile,
    #                 to dynamically generate a new genesis block.
    #  - file: Uses the file provided by GenesisFile as the genesis block.
    GenesisMethod: provisional

    # Genesis profile: The profile to use to dynamically generate the genesis
    # block to use when initializing the orderer system channel and
    # GenesisMethod is set to "provisional". See the configtx.yaml file for the
    # descriptions of the available profiles. Ignored if GenesisMethod is set to
    # "file".
    GenesisProfile: SampleInsecureSolo

    # initializing the orderer system channel and GenesisMethod is set to
    # "file". Ignored if GenesisMethod is set to "provisional".
    GenesisFile: genesisblock

    # LocalMSPDir is where to find the private crypto material needed by the
    # orderer. It is set relative here as a default for dev environments but
    # should be changed to the real location in production.
    LocalMSPDir: msp

    # LocalMSPID is the identity to register the local MSP material with the MSP
    # manager. IMPORTANT: The local MSP ID of an orderer needs to match the MSP
    # ID of one of the organizations defined in the orderer system channel's
    # /Channel/Orderer configuration. The sample organization defined in the
    # sample configuration provided has an MSP ID of "DEFAULT".
    LocalMSPID: DEFAULT

    # BCCSP configures the blockchain crypto service providers.
    BCCSP:
        # Default specifies the preferred blockchain crypto service provider
        # to use. If the preferred provider is not available, the software
        # based provider ("SW") will be used.
        # Valid providers are:
        #  - SW: a software based crypto provider
        #  - PKCS11: a CA hardware security module crypto provider.
        Default: SW

#   SECTION: Kafka

################################################################################
Kafka:

    # Retry: What do if a connection to the Kafka cluster cannot be established,
    # or if a metadata request to the Kafka cluster needs to be repeated.
    Retry:
        # When a new channel is created, or when an existing channel is reloaded
        # (in case of a just-restarted orderer), the orderer interacts with the
        # Kafka cluster in the following ways:
        # 1. It creates a Kafka producer (writer) for the Kafka partition that
        # corresponds to the channel.
        # 2. It uses that producer to post a no-op CONNECT message to that
        # partition
        # 3. It creates a Kafka consumer (reader) for that partition.
        # If any of these steps fail, they will be re-attempted every
        # <ShortInterval> for a total of <ShortTotal>, and then every
        # <LongInterval> for a total of <LongTotal> until they succeed.
        # Note that the orderer will be unable to write to or read from a
        # channel until all of the steps above have been completed successfully.
        ShortInterval: 5s
        ShortTotal: 10m
        LongInterval: 5m
