## Service discovery
In order to dynamically obtain informations of the peers and orderers on the network, such as peers status, configurations, ledger, policy, etc. we add the function of service discovery. 

The service discovery improves this process by having the peers compute the needed information dynamically and present it to the SDK in a consumable manner.
