    # Logging 'module' names are also strings, however valid module names are
    # defined at runtime and are not checked for validity during option
    # processing.

    # Default logging levels are specified here for each of the peer
    # commands. For commands that have subcommands, the defaults also apply to
    # all subcommands of the command. These logging levels can be overridden
    # on the command line using the --logging-level command-line option, or by
    # setting the CORE_LOGGING_LEVEL environment variable.

    # The logging level specification is of the form

    #     [<module>[,<module>...]=]<level>[:[<module>[,<module>...]=]<level>...]

    # A logging level by itself is taken as the overall default. Otherwise,
    # overrides for individual or groups of modules can be specified using the
    # <module>[,<module>...]=<level> syntax.

    # Examples:
    #   info                                       - Set default to INFO
