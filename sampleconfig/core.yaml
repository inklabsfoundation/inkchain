    # The overall default logging level can be specified in various ways,
    # listed below from strongest to weakest:
    #
    # 1. The --logging-level=<level> command line option overrides all other
    #    default specifications.

    #    be set via the environment variable CORE_LOGGING_PEER.

    # If no overall default level is provided via any of the above methods,
    # the peer will default to INFO (the value of defaultLevel in
    # common/flogging/logging.go)
