## Use Cases

The service scope of Ink consortium blockchain involves an independent blockchain at the bottom, transaction platforms for cultural assets, and the following distributed economic ecology.

Today's Creative Industry, especially IP and content ecosphere, is faced with the following problems because of backward infrastructure, serious information asymmetry and centralized governance thinking.

* Unclear ownership results in ineffective incubation of many excellent IPs and content as well as frequent disputes;

* The lack of data authenticity leads to unfair distribution of interests, which greatly frustrates the creative enthusiasm of many high-quality content creators;

* The liquidation threshold is high, and the creators need earlier and more direct content liquidation channels;

* Centralized content management mechanism makes major platforms prioritize mature content creators in terms of resources distribution, and the lack of care and attention to emerging creators leads to the waste of many high-quality content and IP;

* The industry ecology and infrastructure are not sound. In addition to a few head resources, many high-quality creative cultural resources in the upper and middle ends can only be transformed once or initially, and their potential is not fully exploited.

The birth of Ink consortium blockchain is expected to solve these problems thoroughly, thus leading the Creative Industry into a whole new era.
